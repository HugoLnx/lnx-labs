    "description": "First game I made with Patrick Sava to compete on the 2016 Global Game Jam. The game is a satire of the classic Asteroids game. Instead of the player have a spaceship to control and destroy asteroids he have to guide an asteroid through the spaceships shoots so it can finally destroy earth. The project is a fork from G-die prototype because we reused all the animations and state control from it."
